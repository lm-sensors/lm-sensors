chip "it8732-isa-*"

  ### Voltage sense
  ### The labels and equations reverse-engineered by measuring voltages on the board, finding
  ### voltage dividers and comparing the voltages to what is reported in the BIOS.
  ###
  ### No datasheet for IT8732F has been discovered so its unknown what the recommended wiring is.
  ### VIN[0-7] pinout has been taken from IT8782F datasheet it seems to match.

  # These go straight to the IT8732F, confirmed in BIOS Setup
  label in0 "Vcore"
  label in1 "DDR 1.5V"

  # These looks to be a second 3.3V input with a 10k/20k divider
  label in2 "+3.3V_2"
  compute in2 @*((10/20)+1), @/((10/20)+1)

  # in3 is labeled as +3.3V by the it87 driver, supposedly wired internally inside the chip
  # The reported value is halved
  compute in3 @*2, @/2

  # Resistors could not be reverse engineered from the board, a simple scaling factor was calculated
  label in4 "+12V"
  compute in4 @*6.59, @/6.59

  # in5 and in6 are unknown, one of them is most likely the +5V rail but the +5V divider voltage 
  # and the measured voltages do not match.
  # Specifically, the +5V divider outputs 1.86V but in5 reads 1.44V and in6 reads 2.78V

  # in7 is labeled as 3VSB by the it87 driver
  # The reported value is halved
  compute in7 @*2, @/2

  # in8 is labeled as Vbat by the it87 driver, probably wired internally inside the chip
  # The reported value looks to be nonsense as it reports 1.6V without a battery inserted.
  # Ignore for now
  ignore in8

  # Establish a 10% tolerance range for alarms
  set in0_min 1.0 * 0.95
  set in0_max 1.0 * 1.05
  set in1_min 1.5 * 0.95

  ### Temperatures
  ### The BIOS reports only one temperature sensors and labels it "System temperature3", it's obviously temp3
  ### Other temp inputs are not wired
  ignore temp1
  ignore temp2
  label temp3 "System temperature"

  set temp3_max 50

  
  ###
  ### System contains only chassis fans, confirmed in BIOS
  ### The RPM reported for PWM value of 128 is around 5500 RPM
  label fan1 "Chassis fan 1"
  label fan2 "Chassis fan 2"
  label fan3 "Chassis fan 3"

  # Not wired
  ignore intrusion0
