### Voltages

   label  in0  "Vcore"
   label  in1  "DDR3 1.5V" # as labelled in the BIOS.
   label  in2  "+3.3V"
   label  in3  "+5V"     # Not shown in BIOS.
   label  in4  "+12V"
   ignore in5		 # Ambiguous - ignoring.
   ignore in6		 # Ambiguous - ignoring.
   label  in7  "5VSB"    # Not shown in BIOS.
   label  in8  "Vbat"    # Not shown in BIOS.
   ignore cpu0_vid

   # "Vcore", "DDR3 1.5V", "+3.3V" and "Vbat" are connected directly, so no compute
   # line is needed for these. +5V and 5VSB are internal so we use the
   # standard scaling factor. Scaling for +12V is apparently being done with 
   # 8kOhm and 2.7kOhm resistors, this matches my BIOS reading. It's an improvement
   # from the previous proposed scaling value of 3.963.

### Temperatures

   label temp1 "System Temp"
   # This sensor appears to be around or inside the ITE8720F chip.
   # The temperature drops if the chip and board area are cooled with
   # freezer spray. This sensor may be over-reading!
   # Adjustment applied to match internal case thermal sensor from my Antec P160.

   set   temp1_max 50 # Tropical ambient max plus a bit

   label temp2  "CPU Temp"
   # This sensor can show 2 degrees difference to the K10 sensor.
   # The end user can choose which one they prefer.
   set   temp2_min 0
   set   temp2_max 70 # Set to match your BIOS "CPU Warning Temperature"

   ignore temp3	# No idea what this sensor is for. It always shows
		# +78 deg C regardless of BIOS settings.

### Fans

   # Minimum fan speeds.
   # Comment/un-comment fan headers you are using if you want alarms.
