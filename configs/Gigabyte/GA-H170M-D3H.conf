# Configuration for the Gigabyte GA-H170M-D3H (name from the manual) mainboard.
# Name from dmidecode -s baseboard-product-name: H170M-D3H-CF
# BIOS version: F23f
# Driver: it87
# added by dokutan, 2020

chip "it8628-isa-*"
   
    ### voltage sensors
    ### these labels are mostly determined by comparing the values to the values from the bios
    # in1 - 1n5: i have no clue, the bios reports +5V and +12V values,
    # the it87 kernel documentation suggests in3 might be internal to the chip
    # label  in0 "Vcore"     # this value scales with CPU load but seems a bit low (~0.7V to 1.2V)
    # label  in2 "+12V"      # in2*6 is exactly the +12V value from the bios
    label  in6 "Vmemory"     # this is stable and the value from the bios
   
    ### fans
    ### the mappings fan to label are all tested
    label  fan1 "CPU fan"
    label  fan2 "Case fan 1"
    label  fan3 "Case fan 2"
    ignore fan4              # there are only 3 fan headers + CPU fan on this mainboard
    label  fan5 "Case fan 3"
    
    ### temperature sensors
    ### these labels are determined by comparison with other sensors under different load scenarios
    # temp5 correlates with CPU temp, but stays significantly lower
    # temp1, temp4 and temp6 stay relatively low, even under CPU load   
    ignore temp2             # this always gives a reading of +127.0°C
    label  temp3 "CPU temp"  # this might have a 1-2°C difference to the coretemp package sensor
