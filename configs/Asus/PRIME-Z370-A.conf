# lm-sensors configuration for the ASUS PRIME Z370-A motherboard
#
# Manufacturer: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.
# Product Name: PRIME Z370-A
# Version: Rev 1.04
# Super I/O: NCT6793D
# UEFI versions tested: 0805, 1601
#
# Recommended drivers: coretemp, nct6775
# Other Z370 boards from ASUS might use a similar setup
#
# dmesg might show that the kernel failed to bind the nct6775 driver due to an
# ACPI conflict between SystemIO and OpRegion ranges.  Ideally a WMI driver
# should be used instead of directly accessing the Super I/O chip but,
# unfortunally, very little is exposed via WMI, even on the latest UEFI.
#
# You can allow the driver to bind to the chip, regardless of the conflict, by
# setting the kernel command line option:
#
#     acpi_enforce_resources=lax
#
# This is not known to cause issues on the PRIME Z370-A, but you might still
# want to disable thermal and blacklist eeepc_wmi to minimize conflicts:
#
#     thermal.off=1 module_blacklist=eeepc_wmi
