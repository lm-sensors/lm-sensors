    # CPU VCore limits set according to overclockers testing and AMD Max Safe 
    # voltage recommendations.
    # Keep in mind Ryzen CPU's may boost to higher voltages for short times. 
    # This is entirely dependant on individual chip binning.
    # If your chip indicates 1.55V continuously the sensors may not be treated 
    # correctly by your mainboard or you have buggy firmware.
    # In that case It might be actually 1.55V which would correlates with 
    # high heat, or it may be just a bad readout.
    
    # Note: sustained 1.45 is also not safe.
    # I am not sure about the low load voltage drops, they are normal
    # (commonly occuring on many boards) and thus likely a measurement or 
    # sensor anomaly.
    # There is a more accurate on-die voltage sensor with ryzen.
    # but the documentation is covered by NDA. k10-temp would need to be 
    # adapated to read voltages in addition to temperatures like HWInfo64 on 
    # Windows already does.
