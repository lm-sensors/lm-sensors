.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isaset
is a small helper program to set registers visible through the ISA bus.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f
Enable flat address space mode.
.TP
.B \-y
Disable interactive mode.
By default,
.B isaset
will wait for a confirmation
from the user before messing with the ISA bus.
When this flag is used,
it will perform the operation directly.
This is mainly meant to be used in scripts.
.TP
.B \-W
Perform a 16-bit write.
.TP
.B \-L
Perform a 32-bit write.

.SH OPTIONS (I2C-like access mode)
Four options must be provided to
.BR isaset .
.I addrreg
contains the ISA address of the address register for the chip to probe;
.I datareg
contains the address of the data register.
Both addresses are integers between 0x0000 and 0x3FFF.
Usually, if the chip's base address is 0x0nn0,
the address register is at 0x0nn5 and the data register is at 0x0nn6.
The most common base address for hardware monitoring chips is 0x0290.
For Super-I/O chips, address register is typically at 0x2E with data
register at 0x2F.
The
.I address
and
.I value
parameters are two integers between 0x00 and 0xFF.
.B isaset
will write value
.I value
to address
.IR address .
An optional
.I mask
can be provided as a fifth parameter,
preserving unmasked bits at the written location.

.SH OPTIONS (flat address space mode)
In flat mode, two parameters must
be provided.
.I address
contains the ISA address of the register to write to;
it is an integer between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF.
Basically, it is
the sum of the chip's base address and the chip register's address.
.B isaset
will write value
.I value
at this address.
An optional
.I mask
can be provided as a third parameter,
preserving unmasked bits at the written location.

.SH WARNING
Poking around in ISA data space is extremely dangerous.
Running
.B isaset
with random parameters can cause system
crashes, data loss, and worse!
Be extremely careful when using this program.
