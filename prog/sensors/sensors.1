.SH NAME
sensors \- print sensors information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sensors [
.I options
.B ] [
.I chips
.B ]
.br
.B sensors -s [
.I chips
.B ]
.br
.B sensors --bus-list

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sensors
is used to show the current readings of all sensor chips.
.br
.B sensors -s
is used to set all limits as specified in the configuration file.
.br
.B sensors --bus-list
is used to generate bus statements suitable for the configuration file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c, --config-file config-file"
Specify a configuration file. If no file is specified, the libsensors
default configuration file is used. Use `-c /dev/null' to temporarily
disable this default configuration file.
.IP "-h, --help"
Print a help text and exit.
.IP "-s, --set"
Evaluate all `set' statements in the configuration file and exit. You must
be `root' to do this. If this parameter is not specified, no `set' statement
is evaluated.
.IP "-A, --no-adapter"
Do not show the adapter for each chip.
.IP -u
Raw output. This mode is suitable for debugging and for post-processing
of the output by scripts. It is also useful when writing a configuration
file because it shows the raw input names which must be referenced in the
configuration file.
.IP -j
Json output. This mode is suitable for post-processing of the output by scripts.
.IP "-v, --version"
Print the program version and exit.
.IP "-f, --fahrenheit"
Print the temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.
.IP --bus-list
Generate bus statements suitable for using in sensors.conf. Such bus statements
are only needed if you have several chips sharing the same address on different
buses of the same type. As bus numbers are usually not guaranteed to be stable
over reboots, these statements let you refer to each bus by its name rather
than numbers.
.IP "-n, --allow-no-sensors"
Do not fail if no sensors found. The error message will be printed in the log.
.SH FILES
.I /etc/sensors3.conf
.br
.I /etc/sensors.conf
.RS
The system wide configuration file. See
.BR sensors.conf (5)
