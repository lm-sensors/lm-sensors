This package could not have been created without the help of many, many people.
The most notable contributors are listed below. You are probably best off
to mail <sensors@stimpy.netroedge.com> if you have questions, suggestions or
problems.

* Alexander Larsson <alla@lysator.liu.se>
  Wrote the original lm78 module; lm_sensors version 1 was no more than an
  extension of this module. He still likes to keep an eye on current
  developments, but is usually too busy with other things to do much work
  on them
* Philip Edelbrock <phil@netroedge.com>
  Took up the development of the Alex' lm78 module. Responsible for most
  SMBus code, and many, many other things. He is still one of the main
  developers of the current package.
* Frodo Looijaard <frodol@dds.nl>
  Took up the development of Alex' lm78 module. Large pieces of code were
  written by him. Designed lm_sensors version 2, and wrote most of its
  core code, including many drivers.
* William Morgan <wmorgan@cmu.edu>
  Helped with some patches in lm_sensors version 1. He provided us with
  the original CVS archive, and even managed to explain to us how to use
  it.
* Kyösti Mälkki <kmalkki@cc.hut.fi>
  Author of the i2c-via and i2c-viapro host drivers. Sis5595 hack.
  Extended support for GL518SM and GL520SM sensors.
* Mark D. Studebaker <mdsxyz123@yahoo.com>
  Author of the i2c-ali15x3, i2c-i801, and i2c-i810 bus drivers.
  Author (with Bob Dougherty) of the via686a driver.
  Added w83782d, w83783s, w83627hf, and as99127f support to the w83781d driver.
  Added max1617, thmc10, gl523sm, and lm84 support to the adm1021 driver.
  Added lm81 support to the adm9240 driver.
  Added DDC support and i2c-algo-bit layer to the i2c-voodoo3 bus driver.
  Author of the decode-xeon.pl xeon EEPROM decoder.
  Added the RRD interface.
  Author of the ddcmon, icspll, smbus-arp, smsc47m1,
  vt1211, and vt8231 chip drivers.
* Bob Dougherty <bobd@stanford.edu>
  Author (with MDS) of the via686a driver.
* Jonathan Teh Soon Yew <j.teh@iname.com> and Alex van Kaam <darkside@chello.nl>
  Contributed conversion factor data for the via686a driver.
* Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>
  Author of the i2c-hydra driver.
* Adrian Baugh (http://www.adrianbaugh.org.uk/)
  Original author of wmsensors;
  he also tested lots of things, and helped us out on several occasions.
* Fons Rademakers <Fons.Rademakers@cern.ch>
  Author of the maxilife module (which could only be written under NDA)
* Merlin Hughes <merlin@merlin.org>
  Author of the AMD756 module and sensord.
* Constantine Gavrilov <const-g@xpert.com>
  Created and maintains the RPM files
* Simon Vogl <simon@tk.uni-linz.ac.at>
  Wrote the new i2c kernel driver. This driver is indispensable for the
  workings of lm_sensors version 2.
* Gerd Knorr <kraxel@cs.tu-berlin.de> (?)
  Designed the i2c structs, which made it possible to use the smbus-is-
  just-an-i2c-extension approach.
* Chen-Yuan Wu <gwu@esoft.com>
  Author of the adm1025 driver.
* Kris Van Hees <aedil@alchar.org>
