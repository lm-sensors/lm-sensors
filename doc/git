Git Repository

Anonymous access to our git repository is available. This means
that users can have direct access to up-to-the-minute code.

Driver development for kernel version 3 is taking place directly in the kernel
using git. The git repository is only used for user-space tools.

We presume that you have git installed on your machine. To check out a
working copy of the code for this project use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors.git

To update the code, do a git pull from within the lm-sensors directory.
Please read the README and INSTALL files of your working copy for how
to build the code. Also read the related files in the 'doc' directory
for info regarding the different bus and chip drivers. Lastly, you can use
the regular git commands on the files (like git log [filename]) to see the
comments made by the developers as changes were made.

If you're not familiar with the use of we recommend the excellent
online git documentation at https://git-scm.com/doc.
