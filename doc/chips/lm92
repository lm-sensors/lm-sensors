Kernel driver `lm92.o'
======================

Status: Complete and somewhat tested

Supported chips:
  * National Semiconductors LM92
    Prefix `lm92'
    Addresses scanned: I2C 0x48 - 0x4b (inclusive)
  * National Semiconductors LM76
    Prefix `lm92'
    Addresses scanned: none, force parameter needed
  * Maxim MAX6633/MAX6634/MAX6635
    Prefix `lm92'
    Addresses scanned: I2C 0x48 - 0x4f (inclusive)
    MAX6633 with address in 0x40 - 0x47 needs force parameter

Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the National Semiconductors LM92
temperature sensor.

Each LM92 temperature sensor supports a single temperature sensor.
Temperatures are exported to proc in degrees celsius * 10000 (in other
words temperatures are accurate to 4 decimal places). There are alarms
for high, low, and critical thresholds. There's also an hysteresis to
control the thresholds for resetting alarms.

At the moment the driver controls these sensors in comparator mode and the
interrupt pins (INT, T_CRIT_A) are ignored.

Support was added later for the LM76 and Maxim MAX6633/MAX6634/MAX6635,
which are mostly compatible. They have not all been tested, so you
may need to use the force parameter.


Hardware Configurations
-----------------------

The only thing that can be changed is enabling of the fault queue. Doing so
ensures that alarms will only be triggered if 4 consecutive readings all
cross the alarm thresholds. You can enable this behaviour by uncommenting
the #define in the driver source, and then recompile/reinstall.
