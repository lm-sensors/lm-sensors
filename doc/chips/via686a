Module Parameters
-----------------

force_addr=0xaddr	Set the I/O base address. Useful for Asus A7V boards
			that don't set the address in the BIOS. Does not do a
			PCI force; the via686a must still be present in lspci.
			Don't use this unless the driver complains that the
			base address is not set.
			Example: 'modprobe via686a force_addr=0x6000'


Description
-----------

The driver does not distinguish between the chips and reports
all as a 686A.

The Via 686a southbridge has integrated hardware monitor functionality.
It also has an I2C bus, but this driver only supports the hardware monitor.
For the I2C bus driver, see ../busses/i2c-viapro.

The Via 686a implements three temperature sensors, two FAN rotation speed
sensors, five voltage sensors and alarms.

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celcius. An alarm is triggered once
when the Overtemperature Shutdown limit is crossed; it is triggered again
as soon as it drops below the hysteresis value.  A more useful behaviour 
can be found by setting the hysteresis value to +127 degrees Celcius; in 
this case, alarms are issued during all the time when the actual temperature
is above the Overtemperature Shutdown value. Measurements are guaranteed
between -55 and +125 degrees, with a resolution of 1 degree.

FAN rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is
triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. FAN 
readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give
the readings more range or accuracy. This is important because some FANs
report only one 'tick' each rotation, while others report two - making
all readings twice as high. Not all RPM values can accurately be represented,
so some rounding is done. With a divider of 2, the lowest representable
value is around 2600 RPM.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in volts.
An alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum 
or maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to
zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. All voltage
inputs can measure voltages between 0 and 4.08 volts, with a resolution
of 0.016 volt.

If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register
is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may 
already have disappeared!  Note that in the current implementation, all
hardware registers are read whenever any data is read (unless it is less
than 1.5 seconds since the last update). This means that you can easily
miss once-only alarms.

The driver only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often
will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.
