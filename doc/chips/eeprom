Description
-----------

This is a simple EEPROM module meant to enable reading the first 256 bytes
of an EEPROM (on a SDRAM DIMM for example). However, it will access serial
EEPROMs on any I2C adapter. The supported devices are generically
called 24Cxx, and are listed above; however the numbering
for these industry-standard devices may vary by manufacturer.

This module was a programming exercise to get used to the new project
organization laid out by Frodo, but it should be at least completely
effective for decoding the contents of EEPROMs on DIMMs. 

DIMMS will typically contain a 24C01A or 24C02, or the 34C02 variants.
The other devices will not be found on a DIMM because
they respond to more than one address.

DDC Monitors may contain any device. Often a 24C01, which responds
to all 8 addresses, is found. See the 'ddcmon' driver which has
specialized /proc entries for DDC monitors. If the eeprom driver is
loaded before the ddcmon driver and there is no 'ignore' line in the
/etc/sensors.conf file, the eeprom driver will latch onto the DDC monitor
eeprom.

Recent Sony Vaio laptops have an EEPROM at 0x57. We couldn't get the
specification, so it is guess work and far from being complete.

The Microchip 24AA52/24LCS52, ST M34C02, and others support an additional
software write protect register at 0x30 - 0x37 (0x20 less than the
memory location). The chip responds to "write quick" detection at this
address but does not respond to byte reads.
If this register is present, the lower 128 bytes of the memory
array are not write protected. Any byte data write to this address
will write protect the memory array permanently, and the device
will no longer respond at the 0x30-37 address.
The eeprom driver does not support this register.

Lacking functionality:

* Full support for larger devices (24C04, 24C08, 24C16). These are
not typically found on a PC. These devices will appear as separate
devices at multiple addresses.

* Support for really large devices (24C32, 24C64, 24C128, 24C256, 24C512).
These devices require two-byte address fields and are not supported.

* Enable Writing.  Again, no technical reason why not, but making it easy
to change the contents of the EEPROMs (on DIMMs anyway) also makes it easy
to disable the DIMMs (potentially preventing the computer from booting)
until the values are restored somehow.


Use:

After inserting the module (and any other required smbus/i2c modules), you
should have some EEPROM directories in /proc/sys/dev/sensors/ of names such
as "eeprom-i2c-0-50".  Inside each of these is a series of files which
represent 16 bytes blocks from the EEPROM.  The data is in decimal (base
10) delimited by spaces.

Note:

EEPROMs reported are not nessesarily all from DIMMs.  Xeon processors, for
example, have serial EEPROMs in them connected to the SMBus which will be
found by the module.  Take care to ignore the output of decode-dimms.pl for
these EEPROMs.  There is decode-xeon.pl for them.  Same applies to Vaio
EEPROMs, which have decode-vaio.pl.

The driver caches the data from the monitor and only rereads it
from the eeprom if the cache is more than 5 minutes old.


Decode-dimms.pl
---------------

This Perl script attempts to make sense of the first 128 bytes of a SDRAM
PC-100 DIMM.  Using the 'Serial Presence Detect (SPD)' Spec (Rev1.2a)** from
Intel.  When finished, it will decode and report all the values defined in
the spec.  Much of the information is technical timing and interfacing info
(probably not all used by the BIOS or clocking IC).

Note: During testing, we noticed that many DIMMs have trucated SPD records. 
I'm not sure if these conform to an old spec, or if the manufacturers are
simply just taking shortcuts.  But, many DIMMs have all zeros stored past
byte 21.  I asked an Intel SDRAM tester, Sat Kolli (skolli@smartm.com),
about this and this is what he had to say:

"[...] Now in terms of SPD contents, you are right that people do all kinds
of things. The way to insure that any module works is to look for the most
basic information, such as module bank density, number of banks, and device
addresses. That will give you the module size and what devices are used. It
is very difficult to verify if the module is PC-100, because of
inconsistencies between spd data from different manufacturers. You could
read the timing information or the special Intel bytes (126 & 127) but I do
not know how many program that information. These inconsistencies may be
minimized if you or your customers stay with some of the better known
manufacturers."  (Thanks goes to Sat Kolli for his comments and help.)

Use:

After inserting the necessary modules, run the script!

Notes:

The script assumes that Perl can be found at /usr/bin/perl.  If different,
you will need to adjust the first line of the file accordingly, or else
you will get a strange "decode-dimms.pl: no such file or directory" error.

Also note that the script assumes that _all_ the eeproms belong to DIMMs,
which may not be the case.


Decode-vaio.pl
--------------

This Perl script looks for a Sony Vaio EEPROM at 0x57. If your system is not
a Sony Vaio laptop, you just don't care. If your system is an old Vaio, you
probably don't have an EEPROM on it and this script will be useless to you
as well.

Use:

After inserting the necessary modules, run the script!

Notes:

The script assumes that Perl can be found at /usr/bin/perl.  If different,
you will need to adjust the first line of the file accordingly, or else
you will get a strange "decode-vaio.pl: no such file or directory" error.


Decode-edid.pl

This Perl script acts as an interface between the eeprom module and
parse-edid, which is part of read-edid. Read-edid is a tool for gathering
information on VESA PNP monitors. It is somewhat similar to what our
ddcmon driver does, except that ddcmon outputs user-oriented data while
read-edid generates a a computer oriented configuration file (primarily
for XFree86).

Read-edid is made of two components, get-edid which retrieves binary data
from the monitor, and parse-edid which decodes the data into useful
information. Get-edid uses low level functions, and relies on compliance
of both the video card and the monitor to some standard (DCC as it is
called). It may not work for everyone. On the other hand, some video
cards make this information available on an I2C bus and we are able to
get it using our eeprom module. That's why we wrote this script that
converts the data as exported by our eeprom module into what parse-edid
expects from get-edid. That way, users who can't get get-edid to work
still have a chance to be able to retrieve the wanted information thanks
to the lm_sensors modules and tools.

Use:

Unload the ddcmon if it was loaded, load the eeprom module instead. Then,
run the script. The script will try to figure out on which I2C bus and at
which address is the eeprom, but it may fail. In this case, you can pass
the parameters to the script. Examples:

  decode-edid.pl 1
  decode-edid.pl 2 0x50

You will find additional details in the script itself. Read-edid is avilable
