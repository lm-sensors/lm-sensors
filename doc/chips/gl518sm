Description
-----------

IMPORTANT: For the revision 0x00 chip, the
           in0, in1, and in2 values (+5, +3, and +12) CANNOT be read
           unless you use the slow 'iterate' method. Limits will still
           work even when iterate=0. See below. This is a limitation
           of the chip, not the driver.
           Note that the 'iterate' method was trimmed while porting the
           driver to Linux 2.6 as we considered it too ugly for the thin
           benefit.
	   

This driver supports the Genesys Logic GL518SM chip. There are at least
two revision of this chip, which we call revision 0x00 and 0x80. Revision
0x80 chips support the reading of voltages directly, 0x00 only for VIN3.

The GL518SM implements one temperature sensor, two FAN rotation speed
sensors, and four voltage sensors. It can report alarms through the
computer speakers.

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celcius. An alarm goes off while the
temperature is above the over temperature limit, and has not yet dropped
below the hysteresis limit. The alarm always reflects the current situation.
Measurements are guaranteed between -10 degrees and +110 degrees, with
a resolution of +-3 degrees.

FAN rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is
triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit.
In case when you have selected to turn Fan1 off, no Fan1 alarm is triggered.

FAN readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give
the readings more range or accuracy. This is important because some FANs
report only one 'tick' each rotation, while others report two.
Not all RPM values can accurately be represented, so some rounding is done.
With a divider of 2, the lowest representable value is around 1900 RPM.

Voltage sensors (also known as VIN sensors) report their values in volts. An
alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum or
maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to
zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. The VDD input
measures voltages between 0.000 and 5.865 volt, with a resolution of 0.023
volt. The other inputs measure voltages between 0.000 and 4.845 volt, with a
resolution of 0.019 volt. Note that revision 0x00 chips do not support
reading the current voltage of any input except for VIN3; limit setting and
alarms work fine, though. There is code to compute them by iterating.

When an alarm goes off, you can be warned by a beeping signal through
your computer speaker. It is possible to enable all beeping globally,
or only the beeping for some alarms.

If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register
is read at least once (except for temperature alarms). This means that the 
cause for the alarm may already have disappeared!  Note that in the current 
implementation, all hardware registers are read whenever any data is read 
(unless it is less than 1.5 seconds since the last update). This means that 
you can easily miss once-only alarms.

The GL518SM only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often
will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.

Iteration Code
--------------

IMPORTANT: For the revision 0x00 chip only,
you may select between three modes to read the vin0-2 inputs with
the following lines in /etc/sensors.conf:

 set iterate 0    Don't read in0-in2 inputs.
 set iterate 1    Run the iteration loop, this takes up to 10 seconds.
 set iterate 2    Show the results of the last iteration loop,
                  and start a new loop to run in the background.

You may also set the iteration type with
'echo n > /proc/sys/dev/sensors/gl518sm-i2c-x-y/iterate'.

If you have a rev 0x80 chip, the in0-in2 inputs are readable.
In this case, 'iterate' will be read-only and the read value is 3.

This does NOT apply to the Linux 2.6 kernel driver, where the 'iteration'
code was dropped for being too ugly.
