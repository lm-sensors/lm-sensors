Description
-----------
The SAA1064 is a 4-digit LED driver chip for the I2C bus produced by Philips 
Semiconductors. It is designed to provide a byte I2C interface to up to 4 
separate 4-digit displays (16 digits).

This device has eight write-only registers, five are used for a control byte
and the four digit values.

For more informations see the datasheet.


Accessing SAA1064 via /proc interface
-------------------------------------

On detection (i.e. insmod, modprobe et al.), directories are being
created for each detected SAA1064:

/proc/sys/dev/sensors/saa1064-<0>-<1>/
where <0> is the bus the chip was detected on (e. g. i2c-0)
and <1> the chip address ([38..3b]): 
./saa1064-i2c-0-38/

Inside these directories, there are four files each:
bright, test, disp and refresh

The bright, test and disp files are read-write. 

Writing bright sets the output current to the LEDs connected to the
chip and thus the brightness. Range is from 0 to 7 (inclusive). Reading
gives you the last known value.

Writing test sets the segment test mode (all LEDs lit regardless of 
the digit values) on/off (values 0/1). Reading gives you the last 
known value.

Writing up to four values to disp sets the digits. Each value represents 
one segment, while each bit represents one LED of the segment (seven bars 
and one dot usually). Reading gives you the last known value.

The refresh file is read-only. You can't read anything from it, but 
reading it will trigger a refresh in case a power-loss has occurred since
the last refresh.

On module initialization the chip is configured for segment test (test=1), 
full brightness (bright=7), all digit values zeroed.
