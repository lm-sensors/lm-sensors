Description
-----------

Many Xeons and other Intel processors have an embedded i2c temperature
sensor that look very similar to an adm1021 or max1617.

Some Xeons have honest to goodness, real live, actual MAX1617 chips on 
them.  Others Xeons made around the same time have other ADM1021 
compatible chips on them.  They are mounted on the CPU substrate along 
with the processor information EEPROM that is part of that generation of 
Xeon CPU's.

So it's basically impossible to tell a Xeon TEMP sensor from a MAX1617 
since they are in fact the same chip.  The Xeon Temperature sensors spec 
is just a stripped down register spec for the ADM1021 that says the 
"on-board" or "built-in" sensor registers are "reserved".  That way 
Intel could substitute whatever ADM1021 compatible chip was cheapest at 
the time when they built the CPU's.

One reason to use the xeontemp driver is if, when Intel built your 
particular Xeon's, they didn't use any of the ADM1021 compatible chips 
that the ADM1021 driver recognizes.  In that case, using the xeontemp 
driver will get you the temperatures you want without potentially 
messing up something in the sensor.

Another reason is to avoid having 'sensors' report the second
temperature.

Unfortunately, the 533MHz FSB Xeon's, dropped the on-board sensor chip. 
So these new Xeons require a sensor on the motherboard to be connected 
to the thermal diode to read the temperature.  But these 533MHz capable 
motherboards can also accept 400MHz CPU's with the on-board sensor so it 
gets confusing in a hurry for motherboard vendors and users.

If you have 400MHz FSB P4 Xeon CPU's, you should have an on-CPU ADM1021 
compatible sensor at 0x18 or 0x19.  In that case, use the ADM1021 driver 
if it detects a chip at that address.  The CPU DIE temperature (Tj) will 
be the "REMOTE" temperature from this sensor.  The "Board" or "built-in" 
temperature from the ADM1021 will be the temperature of the ADM1021 
compatible itself which is one of the chips you see on the side of the CPU.

If you have sensors at 0x18 and 0x19 that are not detected by the 
ADM1021, and you have 400MHz Xeons, then you may want to try the 
xeontemp driver.

If you have 533MHZ FSB Xeons, then you do *not* have an on-board thermal 
sensor and you should look for CPU temperatures from the other sensors 
on your motherboard. (Winbond chip for example).

If you have an Intel Xeon processor, and sensors-detect recommended
the adm1021 driver, and the address is one of
0x18, 0x1a, 0x29, 0x2b, 0x4c, or 0x4e, and when using the
adm1021 driver, temp1 is invalid but temp2 looks correct, then
it is likely you should use the xeontemp driver instead.

If you have dual Xeons you may have appear to have two separate
adm1021-compatible chips, or two single-temperature sensors,
at distinct addresses.

In summary, the xeontemp module supports one temperature and the 
adm1021 module supports two. Use the module that works best for you.
