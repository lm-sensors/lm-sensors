  List of adapter,address pairs to boldly assume to be present
* force_smartbatt: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs which are unquestionably assumed to contain
  a `smartbatt' chip
* probe: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs to scan additionally
* probe_range: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples to scan additionally
* ignore: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs not to scan
* ignore_range: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples not to scan


Detection
---------

Very poor. Just looks for the presence of some registers.


Uses
----

Provides read-only access to battery voltage, current, temperature,
charge status, time remaining, and alarms.


/proc entries
-------------

Average readings are one minute rolling averages.

  alarms        bitmask
  charge        relative charge, absolute charge (%)
  i             average current, instantaneous current (A)
  temp          temperature (deg. C)
  time          avg. time to empty, avg. time to full,
                instantaneous time to full (min)
  v             max voltage, current voltage (V)


To do
