Kernel driver i2c-nforce2
-------------------------

Status: Well tested

Supported adapters:
    * nVidia nForce2 SMBus PCI interface
      (10de:0064, included in nForce2 MCP,
       10de:0084, included in nForce2 Ultra 400 MCP)
      Datasheet: not publically available, but seems to be similar to the
                 AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0 adapter.

    * nVidia nForce3 SMBus PCI interface
      (10de:00d4, included in nForce3 Pro150 MCP,
       10de:00e4, included in nForce3 250Gb MCP)
      Datasheet: same as for nForce2 SMBus PCI interface

    * nVidia nForce4 SMBus PCI interface
      (10de:0052, included in nForce4 MCP)
      Datasheet: same as for nForce2 SMBus PCI interface

Description
-----------

i2c-nforce2 is a driver for the SMBuses included in the nVidia nForce2,
nForce3 and nForce4 MCP.

If your 'lspci -v' listing shows something like the following,

00:01.1 SMBus: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 0064 (rev a2)
        Subsystem: Asustek Computer, Inc.: Unknown device 0c11
        Flags: 66Mhz, fast devsel, IRQ 5
        I/O ports at c000 [size=32]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>

then this driver should support the SMBuses of your motherboard.


Notes
-----

The SMBus adapter in the nForce2/3/4 chipset seems to be very similar to the
SMBus 2.0 adapter in the AMD-8111 southbridge. However, I could only get the
driver to work with direct I/O access, which is different to the EC interface
of the AMD-8111.
Tested on Asus A7N8X. The ACPI DSDT table of the Asus A7N8X lists two SMBuses,
both of which are supported by this driver.
